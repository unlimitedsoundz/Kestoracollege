1c:T9b9,Finland’s Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment has opened a three-week public consultation on draft amendments that would allow the Finnish Immigration Service (Migri) to cancel the residence permits of non-EU/EEA students who draw basic social assistance. Under current rules, foreign students must show they can fund living costs when applying, but there is no automatic follow-up after arrival. The ministry now wants automated, post-decision monitoring: Migri would receive monthly data from Kela, Finland’s social-insurance agency, and any recorded welfare payment could trigger an immediate investigation and, ultimately, permit withdrawal.

Government officials argue the change is necessary to protect the integrity of Finland’s education-based immigration pathway, which saw 76,000 foreign students enrolled last year. Between September 2023 and December 2025, Migri reviewed 37,000 study permits; 333 holders had received social assistance, but none were cancelled because the law required a wider pattern of dependency. The new text removes that discretion, signalling a tougher stance consistent with Prime Minister Petteri Orpo’s programme to curb what the coalition calls “abuse” of the student route.

Universities Finland (UNIFI) warns the proposal could dent the country’s competitiveness in the global education market, where rivals such as Canada and Germany are already tightening work-hour rules. Finnish institutions rely increasingly on fee-paying non-EU students to offset budget cuts; any perception of instability could push applicants toward other Nordic countries. Student-services teams are urging sponsors and HR departments that fund postgraduate study to establish emergency-support mechanisms so assignees never need to access Kela benefits.

For corporate mobility managers, the draft law adds a new compliance risk. Companies that reimburse interns or trainees must ensure payments reach bank accounts before rent and grocery bills fall due, or the assignee could inadvertently trigger permit cancellation. Experts recommend building welfare-eligibility checks into pre-assignment briefings and confirming that private medical coverage includes mental-health support—another area where students sometimes turn to the state. The consultation closes on 27 February 2026, after which the government intends to submit a bill to Parliament during the spring session. If passed, the rules could take effect as early as summer 2026.12:["$","$L1b",null,{"initialNews":{"id":"d77bb778-0a9f-41ad-b44e-9449f9ddf119","title":"Finland Proposes Welfare-Linked Revocation of International Student Residence Permits.","slug":"international-students","content":"$1c","excerpt":"Finland’s Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment has opened a three-week public consultation on draft amendments that would allow the Finnish Immigration S...","imageUrl":"https://mrqzlmkdhzwvbpljikjz.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/content/i11ku5b2nyi.png","publishDate":"2025-07-05T00:00:00","published":true,"createdAt":"2026-02-08T07:09:11.002","updatedAt":"2026-02-08T07:09:11.002"}}]
